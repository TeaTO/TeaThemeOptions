## Simple, easy to use and fully integrated Theme Options for Wordpress.

The [Tea Theme Options](https://github.com/Takeatea/tea_theme_options) (or **Tea TO**) allows you to easily add professional looking theme options panels to your WordPress theme. The **Tea TO** is built for [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org "CMS Wordpress") v3.x and uses the Wordpress built-in pages.

+ **[Options API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Options_API)** - A simple and standardized way of storing data in the database.
+ **[Transients API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API)** - Very similar to the Options API but with the added feature of an expiration time, which simplifies the process of using the wp_options database table to temporarily store cached information.
+ **[Elasticsearch API](http://www.elasticsearch.org/)** - Elasticsearch creates scaleable, real-time search for your website by indexing all your datas millions of times a day.
+ **[Custom Post Types](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types)** - Here is the simpliest way to create Wordpress Custom Post Types! A new experience with dashicons, complete customisable backend panels, custom fields and datas saved in DB as the good way.
+ **[Custom Taxonomies](http://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies)** - Since the **1.4.2 version**, you are now able to create easily Wordpress Custom Taxonomies with a couple of lines code. The Tea TO permit to add custom fields as you want.
+ **Wordpress Media Manager** - Beautiful interface: A streamlined, all-new experience where you can create galleries faster with drag-and-drop reordering, inline caption editing, and simplified controls.
+ **Easier for administrators** - The interface is thought to be the most userfriendly. The Tea TO core adds some extra interface customisations to make your life easier.
+ **Easier for developers** - Create a new admin panel easily with only 2 lines. The Tea TO core is made to allow non-developer profiles to easily create the settings they need to customise their templates.
